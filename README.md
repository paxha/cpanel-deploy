        with:
          host: 'https://serverxxx.web-hosting.com'
          port: '2083' # Optional. Don't change it unless you know what you're doing
          username: 'your-username' # Your cPanel username
          api_token: '${{ secrets.CPANEL_API_TOKEN }}' # Your cPanel API Token generated by above user.
          remote_path: '/home/your_username/repositories/your_repository'
          branch: main # Optional e.g 'main' or 'master'
